# Eli-TAARG

Introduction

The main scope of this library is the collection of MatLabâ€™s functions for educational purpose. The manual could be considered as a guide to obtain the principal results of the aerodynamic rotary wing theory. In the library, the functions are meant to evaluate different aspects of rotary wing. It is possible to assign geometrical information about different propellers and more specific information as flapping angles. Also there will be the possibility to get Cl-Cd polars thanks to XFoil implementation, characteristics curves and to realize op- timal propeller design function. The documentation has been developed by the students of the Departement of Aerospace Engineering,University of Naples Federico II, over the course of the Aerodynamic Rotary Wing lectures in the 2020/2021 academic year.
